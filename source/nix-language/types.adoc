= Data types

== Strings

Strings are enclosed by double quotes (`"`), or _two_ single quotes (`'`).

    "Hello, world!"

    ''This string contains "double quotes"''

They can span multiple lines.

    ''Old pond
    A frog jumps in
    The sound of water
              -- Basho''

== Integers

    7
    256

== Floating point numbers

    3.14
    6.022e23

== Boolean

The Boolean values in Nix are `true` and `false`.

== Paths

File paths are play an important role in building software, so Nix has a special data type for them.
Paths may be absolute (e.g. `/bin/sh`) or relative (e.g. `./data/file1.csv`).
Note that paths are not enclosed in quotation marks; they are not strings!

Enclosing a path in angle brackets, e.g. <nixpkgs> causes the directories
listed in the environment variable NIX_PATH to be searched for the given
file or directory name.
These are called _lookup paths_.

== Lists

List elements are enclosed in square brackets and separated by spaces (not commas).
The elements need not be of the same type.

    [ "apple" 123 ./build.sh false ]

Lists can be empty.

    []

List elements can be of any type, and can even be lists themselves.

    [ [ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ] ]

== Attribute sets

Attribute sets associate keys with values.
They are enclosed in curly brackets, and the associations are terminated by semi-colons.
Note that the final semi-colon before the closing bracket is required.

    { name = "Professor Paws"; age = 10; species = "cat"; }


Attribute sets can be empty.

    {}

Values of attribute sets can be of any type, and can even be attribute sets themselves.

    { name = { first = "Professor"; last = "Paws"; }; age = 10; species = "cat"; }

[NOTE]
====
In some Nix documentation, and in many articles about Nix,
attribute sets are simply called "sets".

== Functions

We'll learn how to write functions later in this chapter.
For now, note that functions are "first-class values",
meaning that they can be treated like any other data type.
For example, a function can be assigned to a variable, appear as an element in a list,
or be associated with a key in an attribute set.

    [ "apple" 123 ./build.sh false (x: x*x) ]
    { name = "Professor Paws"; age = 10; species = "cat"; formula = (x: x*2); }
