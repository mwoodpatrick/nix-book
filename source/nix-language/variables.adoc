= Variables

You can declare variables in Nix and assign values to them.
// TODO explain that values are immutable.

[source]
....
nix-repl> a = 7

nix-repl> b = 3

nix-repl> a - b
4
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
As mentioned previously, omitting the spaces around operators can have unexpected results.
As Nix allows hyphens (`-`) in variable names,
`a-b` is interpreted as the name of a variable in the following example.

[source]
....
nix-repl> a-b
error: undefined variable 'a-b'

       at «string»:1:1:

            1| a-b
             | ^
....
