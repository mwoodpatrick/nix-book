= Boolean operations

The usual boolean operators are available.
Recall that earlier we set `a = 7` and `b = 3`.

....
nix-repl> a == 7                     # equality test
true

nix-repl> b != 3                     # inequality
false

nix-repl> a > 12                     # greater than
false

nix-repl> b >= 2                     # greater than or equal
true

nix-repl> a < b                      # less than
false

nix-repl> b <= a                     # less than or equal
true

nix-repl> !true                      # logical negation
false

nix-repl> (3 * a == 21) && (a > b)   # logical AND
true

nix-repl> (b > a) || (b > 10)        # logical OR
false
....

One operator that might be unfamiliar to you is _logical implication_, which uses the symbol `->`.
The expression `u -> v` is equivalent to `!u || v`.

....
nix-repl> u = false

nix-repl> v = true

nix-repl> u -> v
true

nix-repl> v -> u
false
....
