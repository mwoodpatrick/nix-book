= Introducing the Nix language

Nix and NixOS use a functional programming language called _Nix_
to specify how to build and install software,
and how to configure system, user, and project-specific environments.
(Yes, “Nix” is the name of both the package manager and the language it uses.)

Nix is a _functional_ language.
In a _procedural_ language such as C or Java,
the focus is on writing a series of _steps_ (statements) to achieve a desired result.
By contrast, in a functional language the focus is on _defining_ the desired result.

In the case of Nix, the desired result is usually a _derivation_:
a software package that has been built and made available for use.
The Nix language has been designed for that purpose,
and thus has some features you don't typically find in general-purpose languages.
