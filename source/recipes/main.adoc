= Recipes

This chapter provides examples of how to use Nix in a variety of scanarios.
Multiple types of recipes are provided are provided for some scenarios;
comparing the different recipes will help you better understand Nix.

- An _"ad hoc" shell_
is useful when you want to quickly create an environment
for a one-off task.

- A _traditional nix shell_
is useful when you want to define an environment that you will
use more than once.

- _Nix flakes_
are the recommended approach for development projects.

- You can use `nix-shell` to run scripts in arbitrary languages, providing
the necessary dependencies. This is particularly convenient for
standalone scripts because you donâ€™t need to create a repo and write a
separate `flake.nix`.
The script should start with two _"shebang"_ (`#!`) commands. The first
should invoke `nix-shell`. The second should declares the script
interpreter and any dependencies.
