= Nix-shell shebangs

You can use `nix-shell` to run scripts in arbitrary languages, providing
the necessary dependencies. This is particularly convenient for
standalone scripts because you donâ€™t need to create a repo and write a
separate `flake.nix`.

The script should start with two "`shebang`" (`#!`) commands. The first
should invoke `nix-shell`. The second should declares the scrpt
interpreter and any dependencies. Here are some examples.
