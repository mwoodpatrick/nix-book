= Shell with access to a package from the Nixpkgs/NixOS repo

This shell provides access to two packages from nixpkgs: hello and
cowsay.

[source,nix,linenums]
.shell.nix
....
include::shell.nix[]
....

Hereâ€™s a demonstration using the shell.

....
$# echo '$ nix-shell'
$# nix-shell --run bash <<EOL
$ hello
$ cowsay "moo"
$# EOL
....

The command-line equivalent would be `nix-shell -p hello cowsay`
